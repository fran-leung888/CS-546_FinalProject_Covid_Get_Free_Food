#3.Introduction 
  Due to the Covid-19, the world is shrouded in the shadow of an economic downturn, especially some low-income people, it is even more difficult to survive. So, we wanted to design a non-profit website, together with the Hoboken restaurant, with the theme: "No waste, give you delicious food". In this way, it can help lowincome people who cannot eat enough, reduce the pressure on the government, and improve people's life happiness index. The location is mainly Hoboken. Many restaurants that voluntarily join in food sharing will serve new excess food every evening. The main purpose is to consume the remaining food without causing waste, and secondly, to provide a touch of warmth to the low-income people under the epidemic and to taste fresh food for free.
